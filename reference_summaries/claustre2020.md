## Claustre 2020 Summary

### Notes

**Main topics of interest involving BCG-Argo:**
 - Biological carbon pump
 - Ocean carbon uptake
 - Phytoplankton communities

**Scientific ambitions from the data:**
 - Better understanding of bio carbon pump and air-sea C02 exchanges
 - Effect humans have on the ecosystem overtime
 - Potential to bridge gap between satellite data (our project)

**BCG-Argo floats observe 6 variables (443 floats equipped with bio-optical sensors [concerning our project]), including:**
 - Oxygen
 - Nitrate
 - pH
 - Chlorophyll *a*
 - Suspended particles

 * Floats have high vertical resolution (up to the meter scale)

**Float lifecycle:**
 1. Float descends to 1000m
 2. Float drifts for about 9 days
 3. Float descends to 2000m
 4. Variables are measured using float sensors as float ascends to surface
 5. Float spends 30 mins at surface to relay data to satellite and receive new parameters
 6. Repeat

**Common issues with BCG-Argo from a research standpoint:**
 - Undersampling (lack of capital to release enough floats)
 - Chlorophyll *a* concentration can vary due to taxonomy, light, nutrients and physiology, resulting in +-50% measurement accuracy

### Research Overview from BCG-Argo Data

**Biological Carbon Pump**
 - Production of organic matter lowers CO2 in surface waters, in turn influencing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere
Pump process: Produce in sunlit waters, remove material into deepwater for long period of time

Stats involving carbon pump:
 - ANCP (Annual net community production): gross photosynthesis - respiration of amimals and bacteria
 - EP (Export production): loss of material from upper ocean by vertical processes

 **Air-Sea Gas Exchange**

The air-sea gas exchange removes approx. 25% of human cause carbon emission each year, in turn acidifying and warming the oceans in the process. Key concept: Oxygen utilization. Research makes use of pH sensors.

**BCG-Argo and Sattelite Synergies**
"Optical variables, such as chlorophyll *a*, backscattering by particles (*bbp*), and radiometry are measured by both BCG-Argo floats and ocean-color satellite sensors, allowing for synergetic and complementary use of both types of data"

Operations begin by looking for colocated matchups of satellite and float data to both intertwine and validate one anothers captured data.

Machine learning opens new ways to combine BCG-Argo and ocean-color remote-sensing satellites, along with the development of 3 and 4-D global climatologies of *bbp*, a proxy for particulate organic carbon (POC).
