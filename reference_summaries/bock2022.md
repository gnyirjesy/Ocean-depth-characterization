Bock Paper

Main ideas:

- We need to identify ecologically similar marine provinces in order to understand and predict biological processes in the ocean
- Current data collection technologies make it difficult to get detailed data of the composition beneath the ocean surface (so these provinces are currently defined using surface-level data, from satellites)
- Paper identifies 6 phytoplankton biomes (2-high latitutude biomes in the summer and 4 mid to low during rest of the year)
- BCG-Argo floats provide high frequency measurements of the ocean subsurface over a long time period

Data:

- Comes from 205 floats
- Measurements include CHLA, BBP, temperature, salinity and four other variables

Methodologies:

- Used EOF (decomposed dataset into set of orthogonal basis vectors) to look at the contributions to overall variability of the features
- Determination of environmental params:
    - Seasonality based on range of months and north or south hemisphere
    - Mixed layer depth: depth where potential density increased above 0.03kg/m^-3
    - Used algorithms to get estimates for nitrate, phosphate and silicate
    - Underwater light: used PAR measurements

Results summary:

- First 6 singular vectors in EOF accounted for 81% of the variability in the data
