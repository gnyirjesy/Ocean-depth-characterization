## Project objective

Employ machine learning methods to oceanographic data obtained by satellites and BGC-Argo floats to characterize and infer subsurface chlorophyll a distributions at a global scale. Link the high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data with the very low spatial resolution subsurface data obtained by floats. Utilize and expand upon depth normalization, biome classification, and distribution fitting explored in previous work and literature, namely Sauzède et al. 2016 and Bock et al. 2022.

## Results

After substantial data pre-processing, model selection, and post-processing, we ultimately landed on a multi-step procedure to predict chlorophyll a at 25 depths based solely on the location, time of year, and satellite-derived surface-level ocean measurements. At a high level, our overall approach can be summarized with the following process:

1.  **Depth-normalization**: identifies the maximum euphotic zone depth and standardizes inputs for each training example respectively.
2.  **XGBoost Regressor**: predicts chlorophyll a at 11 standardized depths, equally spaced with respect to the euphotic zone.
3.  **Neural network**: further refines the XGB model’s predictions and combats overfitting.
4.  **Post-processing**: combines predictions from the neural network with a location-specific characteristic distribution equation based on location, smooths predictions, and extends the dimensionality of the final predictions from 11 to 25.

Our model achieves a test R2 value of 0.66, demonstrating that satellite-derived surface-level ocean measurements can be used to generate subsurface chlorophyll distributions. As a result, our model acts as a potential zero-cost substitute for the otherwise resource-intensive process of manually collecting chlorophyll measurements.
