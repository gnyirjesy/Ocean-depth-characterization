# Ocean-depth-characterization
Data Science Capstone Project focused on extending satellite observations to ocean depths with machine learning

**Project objective**

Employ machine learning methods to oceanographic data obtained by satellites and BGC-Argo floats to characterize and infer subsurface phytoplankton dynamics and carbon export at a global scale. Link the high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data with the very low spatial resolution subsurface data obtained by floats. Extrapolate biomes from a previous study (Bock et al. 2020) based on satellite data.
